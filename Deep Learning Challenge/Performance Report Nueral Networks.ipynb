    "# Performance Report for Alphabet Soup Neural Network Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the Analysis\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is to develop and evaluate a deep learning model for predicting the success of funding applications for the Alphabet Soup charitable organization. By identifying patterns in past applications, this model aims to assist the organization in making data-driven decisions about future funding opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Variable(s):**\n",
    "- The target variable is `IS_SUCCESSFUL`, which indicates whether the funding application was successful (1) or not (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Variables:**\n",
    "- `APPLICATION_TYPE`\n",
    "- `AFFILIATION`\n",
    "- `CLASSIFICATION`\n",
    "- `USE_CASE`\n",
    "- `ORGANIZATION`\n",
    "- `STATUS`\n",
    "- `INCOME_AMT`\n",
    "- `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`\n",
    "- `ASK_AMT`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Removed Variables:**\n",
    "- `EIN` and `NAME` columns were removed as they do not contribute to the prediction and serve as unique identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions:**\n",
    "- The neural network consisted of:\n",
    "    - **Input Layer:** Adjusted to match the number of features in the data.\n",
    "    - **Hidden Layers:** 2-3 layers with 32 to 128 neurons each.\n",
    "    - **Activation Functions:** ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) for hidden layers to introduce non-linearity.\n",
    "    - **Output Layer:** A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.\n",
    "- The architecture was chosen to balance complexity with performance and avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Performance:**\n",
    "- The target performance metric, likely accuracy or loss, was not fully achieved within the initial attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Improve Performance:**\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:** Optimization of categorical data encoding and outlier handling.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjustments to batch size, epochs, and learning rates.\n",
    "- **Additional Layers:** Experimenting with more or fewer neurons and layers.\n",
    "- **Regularization Techniques:** Adding dropout layers to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "The neural network demonstrated moderate success in predicting funding outcomes but fell short of the target performance metric. This limitation highlights potential improvements, such as exploring alternative models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "Gradient boosting algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) can improve performance on imbalanced data and extract non-linear relationships. Theyâ€™re more interpretable and require less hyperparameter tuning, making them a good alternative for binary classification."
